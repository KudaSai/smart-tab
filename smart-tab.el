;;; Commentary:
;;
;; From http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/TabCompletion#toc2. There are a
;; number of available customizations on that page.
;;
;; To activate, add:
;;     (require 'smart-tab)
;;     (global-smart-tab-mode 1)
;;
;; to your .emacs file, or set `global-smart-tab-mode' to non-nil with
;; customize.

  "Try to 'do the right thing' when tab is pressed.
`smart-tab' attempts to expand the text before the point, indent
the current line or selection, or complete a string (when in the
minibuffer). 

If tab is pressed while in the minibuffer, then
`minibuffer-complete' is called, unless an `ido-completing-read'
is in progress, in which case `ido-complete' is called. This lets
`smart-tab' work correctly both when completing with ido and when
using the default completion.

In a regular buffer, `smart-tab' will attempt to expand with
either `hippie-expand' or `dabbrev-expand', depending on the
value of `smart-tab-using-hippie-expand'. If the mark is active,
or PREFIX is \\[universal-argument], then `smart-tab' will indent
the region or the current line (if the mark is not active)."
